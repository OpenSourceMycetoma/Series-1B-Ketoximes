The horticultural fungicide pyrifenox was tested against eumycetoma causing fungi as part of the same screen that marked fenarimol as a possible antifungal drug lead

This project aims to produce optimized analogues of pyrifenox for possible use against invasive fungal infections in humans 

Pyrifenox and fenarimol share the same enzymatic target as posaconazole and itraconazole‡ - the current gold standard for eumycetoma treatment 

‡ as per the Fungicide Resistance Action Committee
